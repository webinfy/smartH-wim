                (d)You agree that we will not be liable in any way for any payments that you may receive, regardless of whether you authorized the Sender to send them to you.<br/>
                (e)We will use reasonable efforts to complete all your Payment Instructions properly. However, we shall incur no liability if we are unable to complete any transaction because of the existence of any one or more of the following circumstances:<br/>
                1. If, through no fault of ours, the Eligible Transaction Account does not contain sufficient funds/credit to complete the Payment Instruction or the Payment Instruction would exceed the credit limit of your overdraft account;<br/>

            </p>

            <h2>Initiation of Payment transfer Instructions</h2>
            <p>
                You may initiate (a) a one-time Payment Instruction to a Receiver for which processing shall be initiated immediately, (b) a one-time Payment Instruction to a Receiver for which processing shall be initiated at a later specified date up to thirty (30) days, and (c) a recurring series of Payment Instructions to a Receiver for which processing shall be initiated on the specified dates. Further details about any such & each of these options can be found on the Site.
                Payment Instructions initiated to Receivers are processed in two ways. You can provide all the required information about the Receiver, including his/her Eligible Transaction Account, necessary to complete a transfer of funds. Alternatively, you can provide contact information about the Receiver (including an email address and/or mobile telephone number) and the Service may contact the Receiver and request that the Receiver (i) provide information so that we may validate the identity of the Receiver at the Site and then (ii) provide Eligible Transaction Account information in order to complete the Payment Instruction (a "Two-Step Transfer") or alternatively EBS may fetch account details from participating networks including but not limited to banks to match the account number matched to the mobile number of email address provided. If the Receiver maintains an Eligible Transaction Account with an institution that participates in or offers the SmartHub service, the Receiver may access the Service at his or her financial institution’s website or mobile application to complete the Payment Instruction and receive the payment.
                You understand and agree that when you initiate a Payment Instruction from an Eligible Transaction Account using the Service, the processing of the Payment Instruction will begin and the debiting of your Eligible Transaction Account will occur as early as the day of such initiation. However, the payment funds will be transferred into the Receiver's Eligible Transaction Account no earlier than the next 3 Business Day after you initiated the Payment Instruction subject to receipt of proper funds into Nodal from the sender’s eligible account. If you request a one-time Payment Instruction to be initiated on a specified date or a recurring series of Payment Instruction to be initiated on specified dates, then the processing of the Payment Instruction will begin on the specified date(s) and the debiting of your Eligible Transaction Account will occur as early as the specified date(s). However, the payment funds will be transferred into the Receiver’s Eligible Transaction Account no earlier than the next three (3) Business Day following the specified date. The Site may contain additional information regarding the delivery of a payment to an Eligible Transaction Account and the same would be updated from time to time. Users agree to read and adhere to the same. 
                You acknowledge and agree that we will begin to process the requested transfer of funds once the Receiver has provided (or we otherwise obtain) all required information, and you hereby authorize and direct us to retain such funds until the earlier of such time as the Receiver has provided (or we otherwise obtain) all required information or ten (10) business days or such period until refunded back to the sender. You further acknowledge and agree that our receipt of money to be transmitted to a Receiver shall not be deemed to have occurred and our obligation to complete a transaction shall not begin until such time as the Receiver provides us with (or we otherwise obtain) all required information necessary to process the related Payment Instruction in accordance with this Agreement. Any cancellation of a Payment Instruction prior to the Receiver providing us with such information shall be subject to the provisions of Payment Cancellation, Stop Payment Requests and Refused Payments provisions as per below.
            </p>


            <h2>Receiving Payments</h2>
            <p>
                If you want to initiate a Payment Instruction (in response to a SmartHub Request or otherwise) using the Service to an Eligible Transaction Account you hold or, if you as a Requestor want to initiate a SmartHub Request, he, she or you can do that from an Eligible Transaction Account at a financial institution that participates in the SmartHub service or at the Site.
                You understand and agree that there may be a delay between the time you are notified of the pending Payment Instruction and the deposit of the payment funds into your Eligible Transaction Account, and you may be required to take additional steps to facilitate the deposit of the payment of funds into your Eligible Transaction Account. You authorize the Sender, the financial institution which holds the Sender's Eligible Transaction Account and us (including through the Site) to send emails to you and text messages to your mobile phone in connection with the Sender's initiation of Payment Instructions to you, and, as a Receiver, you may also receive SmartHub Requests from others through the Service.
                You acknowledge and agree that in the event that funds are transferred into your Eligible Transaction Account as a result of a Payment Instruction and it is determined that such transfer was improper because it was not authorized by the sender, because there were not sufficient funds in the sender's account, or for any other reason, then you hereby authorize us to withdraw from your Eligible Transaction Account an amount equal to the amount of funds improperly transferred to you.
                If you as a Requestor initiate a SmartHub Request using the Service you acknowledge and agree that as disclosed on the Site, (a) the applicable service fee may be deducted from payments received by you from a Sender(s). You acknowledge and agree that individuals to whom you send a SmartHub Request may not receive, or otherwise may reject or ignore, your SmartHub Request. We do not guarantee that you will receive any payments from individuals by initiating a SmartHub Request.
            </p>

            <h2>Payment Cancellation, Stop Payment Requests and Refused Payments</h2>
            <p>
                Sender may cancel the initiation of a Payment Instruction or stop a Payment Instruction at any time until the processing of the Payment Instruction into the Receiver’s Eligible Transaction Account has begun. Our ability to stop a Payment Instruction or recover funds associated with an unauthorized Payment Instruction will depend on the manner in which the Payment Instruction was initiated, and whether the Payment Instruction to the Receiver’s Eligible Transaction Account has begun processing. Although we will make a reasonable effort to accommodate a stop payment request and to recover funds associated with an unauthorized Payment Instruction, we will have no liability for failing to do so. We may also require you to present your stop payment request or request to recover funds in writing within three (3) days after contacting us. The charge for each stop payment or fund recovery request will be the current charge for such stop payment or funds recovery service as set out in the applicable fee schedule or as disclosed through the Site. Payments not claimed by a Receiver will be automatically cancelled three (3) days after the processing of the payment begins. When a Sender initiates a Payment Instruction, the Receiver is not required to accept the payment. You agree that you as a Sender will not hold us liable for any damages resulting from a Receiver’s decision to accept or not to accept a payment initiated or attempted through the Service. We will, to the extent permitted by law, make reasonable attempts to return any unclaimed, refused, refunded, prohibited, or denied payment to your Eligible Transaction Account or use other reasonable efforts to return such payment to you as permitted by law.
            </p>

            <h2>Refused Payments</h2>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to refuse to pay any Receiver either on our judgement or at the behest of the bank/Issuer/financial institution/sender. We will attempt to notify the Sender promptly if we decide to refuse to pay a Receiver designated by the Sender. This notification is not required if you attempt to make a prohibited payment under this Agreement.
            </p>

            <h2>Returned Payments</h2>
            <p>
                In using the Service, you understand that Receivers may reject payments or otherwise return payment. In such event the funds, if received in the Nodal bank shall be remitted back to sender within 3 business days post clear receipt of funds and proper reconciliation. EBS reserves the right to levy any additional fee or charge in case of such returned payments.
            </p>

            <h2>Information Authorization</h2>
            Your enrolment in the Service may not be fulfilled if we cannot verify your identity or other necessary information. Through your enrolment in the Service as a Sender, you agree that we may request a review of your credit rating at our own expense through an authorized bureau. In addition, you agree that we may obtain personal information about you as described in our Privacy Policy.

            <h2>Cardholder Agreements</h2>
            These Terms do not amend or otherwise modify the cardholder agreement or any other terms and conditions of your Issuer.
